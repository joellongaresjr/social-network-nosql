## Code Highlights

One of the requirements of this assignment was to use getter methods in formulating dates, and upon research, I came across a Javascript library known as "Moment.js" which allowed me to display dates and times easier. Below are code highlights in how our incorpated it in the application!

## Learning Points

* This assignment from Berkley's Extension Program provided me with a valuable learning opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of NoSQL & MongoDb. 

* Incorporated new Javascript library to formate dates (if i wanted to incorpate seconds, this library makes it easier in doing so!)
